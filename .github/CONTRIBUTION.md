## Coding Style
Sakoo Uses ___Symfony___ Coding Style. This will be applied using the `PHPCSFixer` tool.
You can run `make stylefix` to set your code in our standards, automatically.

Also, this is one of our Code Integration (CI) pipeline steps.
So, if your code hasn't our standards, the CI pipeline will be failed.
